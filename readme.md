# Wijs Start Theme #

This is our start theme. This is where we put the stuff we find ourselves typing over and over again.

## CSS & Sass/SCSS ##

You may notice the theme contains a core/layout/css and core/layout/scss folder. When you start a project and you want to use plain old CSS: go ahead! If you feel a bit super-powered today, then dive into the *scss* folder and start there. In order to get started with scss, you can:

1. Use a programme like [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit) to watch for changes.
2. Use the Sass Ruby gem to watch for changes via Terminal.
	* Install Sass via terminal: run `sudo gem install sass`
	* `cd` to your theme folder
	* Keep `scss --watch core/layout/scss:core/layout/css` running in a terminal window
	* Happy editing!
